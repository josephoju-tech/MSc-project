**Design and Implementation of a Hotel Management Software**
------------------------------------------------------------
In a bid to address the challenge of managing the influx of customers in hotels.
I channelled my research project towards the development of Hotel Management Software.
The project is designed and developed by transmitting the daily operations procedure
of Childa Int’l Hotel, Abuja, Nigeria hotel into software that provides
an interactive and user-friendly interface to support customers with the
functionality of self-service in making reservations, room/ conference hall bookings,
requesting and paying for any of the hotel services. Thereby reducing the hotel’s
operational cost and increasing customers satisfaction.
The developed software has provision for running queries and generating reports.
